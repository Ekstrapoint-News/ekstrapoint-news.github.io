Twice a year, the clocks move forward or back across Europe and Canada. While it might only seem like a minor adjustment—losing or gaining an hour—this time change brings fresh opportunities for online casino players. At EkstraPoint, we believe a little shift in your schedule can help you make the most of casino bonuses, free spins, and slot competitions.

Whether you’re in Denmark, Germany, the UK, Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, Finland, or Canada, here’s how you can turn the time change into your advantage for the ultimate online gaming experience.

## Make the Most of Extra Time with Free Slot Tournaments

When the clock springs forward or falls back, your daily routine shifts. This is the perfect moment to check out daily slot tournaments and leaderboard slot challenges on EkstraPoint. With your schedule shaken up, why not use that extra hour to join a **free to play** slot competition and climb the slot tournament leaderboard?

### How to Win During the Time Change:
- **Set a New Gaming Routine:** Take advantage of the time shift to engage with **free slots tournaments** at new hours—competition might be lighter!
- **Join Weekly and Monthly Tournaments:** With the time change, your availability could line up perfectly with our weekly slot tournaments and monthly slot tournaments.

## Maximize Loyalty Points and Unlock Rewards
